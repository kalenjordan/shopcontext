# Privacy Policy for ShopContext

**Last Updated: August 13, 2025**

## Overview

ShopContext ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our browser extension.

## Information Collection and Use

### What We Collect

ShopContext operates entirely within your browser and:

- **Does NOT collect** any personal information
- **Does NOT track** your browsing history
- **Does NOT store** any user data on external servers
- **Does NOT use** cookies or tracking technologies
- **Does NOT share** any information with third parties

### Local Storage Only

The Extension only stores data locally in your browser, including:
- Your toggle preferences (enabled/disabled state)
- Custom store name settings
- These settings remain on your device and are never transmitted elsewhere

## Data Processing

All data processing occurs locally within your browser:
- The Extension reads the current webpage to detect Shopify admin interfaces
- Store ID and context information is extracted from the page you're viewing
- Custom injected elements are generated dynamically based on local settings
- No data leaves your browser

## Permissions Used

The Extension requires certain browser permissions to function:

- **Active Tab**: To read and modify Shopify admin pages you're currently viewing
- **Storage**: To save your preferences locally in your browser
- **Host Permissions**: To run on Shopify admin domains (*.myshopify.com/admin/*)

These permissions are used solely for the Extension's core functionality and not for data collection.

## Third-Party Services

ShopContext does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs.

## Data Security

Since no data is transmitted or stored externally, your information remains secure within your browser's local storage. You can clear this data at any time by:
- Uninstalling the Extension
- Clearing your browser's storage for the Extension
- Using your browser's privacy settings

## Children's Privacy

The Extension does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.
